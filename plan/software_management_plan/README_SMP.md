# Software Management Plan (SMP)

A folder named "plan/software_management_plan" within a deposit accompanying a research paper typically contains documents related to the software management plan (SMP) for the research project. Here's what you might find in a "plan/software_management_plan" folder:

1. Software Management Plan Document: The primary document outlining the strategies and procedures for managing the software developed or used in the research project. This document typically includes information about software development practices, version control, documentation, licensing, dissemination, maintenance, and sustainability.
2. SMP Template or Guidelines: A template or set of guidelines used to create the software management plan document. These resources provide a structured framework for researchers to address key aspects of software management and ensure completeness and consistency across plans.
3. Version Control System Documentation: Information about the version control system used to manage the software source code, such as Git or SVN. This documentation may include instructions for accessing the repository, branching strategies, commit guidelines, and collaboration workflows.
4. Documentation Standards: Guidelines or templates for documenting the software code, including comments, README files, user manuals, and technical documentation. Documentation standards ensure that the software is well-documented, understandable, and accessible to users and developers.
5. Licensing Information: Details about the licensing terms under which the software is distributed or made available to others. Licensing ensures legal compliance and clarifies the rights and obligations associated with using, modifying, sharing, or redistributing the software.
6. Dissemination Strategies: Strategies for disseminating the software to the broader community, including publication in software repositories, demonstration at conferences, workshops, or seminars, and outreach activities to relevant stakeholders.
7. Maintenance and Support Plans: Plans for maintaining and supporting the software over time, including bug fixes, updates, user support, and community engagement. Maintenance and support ensure that the software remains functional, reliable, and relevant to users' needs.
8. Archiving and Preservation Strategies: Strategies for archiving and preserving the software code and associated documentation for long-term access and reuse. Archiving ensures that the software remains available and accessible even if the original developers are no longer actively maintaining it.
9. Citation Information: Guidance on how to cite the software management plan document in scholarly publications, ensuring proper attribution to the authors and contributors of the software.
10. Archived Software Management Plan: Copies or versions of the software management plan document archived in a data repository or institutional repository for future reference and transparency. Archiving the SMP ensures that it is accessible and retrievable throughout the lifecycle of the research project.

By organizing these documents in the "plan/software_management_plan" folder, researchers demonstrate their commitment to managing and sharing research software responsibly. Software management plans help ensure the sustainability, reproducibility, and impact of research software, facilitating collaboration and knowledge exchange within the scientific community.
