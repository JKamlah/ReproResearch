# Preregistration

A folder named "plan/preregistration" within a deposit accompanying a research paper typically contains documents related to the preregistration of the research project. Preregistration involves publicly documenting the research hypotheses, study design, data collection methods, and analysis plan before conducting the research. Here's what you might find in a "plan/preregistration" folder:

1. Preregistration Document: The main document outlining the preregistration details, including the research hypotheses, study design, variables of interest, data collection procedures, planned analyses, and statistical methods. This document serves as a protocol for conducting the research and helps prevent outcome reporting bias.
2. Preregistration Form or Template: A standardized form or template used to create the preregistration document. Preregistration forms typically prompt researchers to provide specific details about the research design and analysis plan, ensuring completeness and consistency across preregistrations.
3. Preregistration Platform Submission: Evidence of submission or registration of the preregistration document on a preregistration platform, such as the Open Science Framework (OSF) or AsPredicted. Preregistration platforms provide a public record of preregistered research plans, enhancing transparency and accountability.
4. Metadata Standards: Information about metadata standards or schemas used to describe and document the preregistration. Metadata standards ensure consistency, interoperability, and comprehensibility of the preregistration across different platforms and disciplines.
5. Version Control Information: Documentation of version control practices used to track changes and updates to the preregistration document over time. Version control ensures transparency and traceability of modifications made to the preregistration protocol.
6. Citation Information: Guidance on how to cite the preregistration document in scholarly publications, ensuring proper attribution to the preregistered research plan.
7. Archived Preregistration: Copies or versions of the preregistration document archived in a data repository or preregistration platform for future reference and transparency. Archiving the preregistration ensures that it is accessible and retrievable throughout the lifecycle of the research project.

By organizing these documents in the "plan/preregistration" folder, researchers demonstrate their commitment to transparent and rigorous research practices. Preregistration helps reduce bias, increase transparency, and enhance the credibility and reproducibility of research findings.
