# Project proposal

A folder named "plan/project_proposal" within a deposit accompanying a research paper typically contains documents related to the project proposal for the research project. Here's what you might find in a "plan/project_proposal" folder:

1. Project Proposal Document: The primary document outlining the proposed research project. This document typically includes details such as the research objectives, research questions, background literature review, methodology, expected outcomes, timeline, budget, and personnel involved in the project.
2. Proposal Template or Guidelines: A template or set of guidelines used to create the project proposal document. These resources provide a structured framework for researchers to address key aspects of the proposed research and ensure completeness and consistency across proposals.
3. Budget Justification: A detailed explanation or justification of the budget allocation for the proposed research project. This may include itemized lists of expenses such as personnel salaries, equipment costs, travel expenses, and other project-related expenditures.
4. Personnel Biosketches or CVs: Biographical sketches or curriculum vitae (CVs) of key personnel involved in the research project, such as principal investigators, co-investigators, collaborators, or research staff. Biosketches provide information about the qualifications, expertise, and contributions of the project team members.
5. Letters of Support or Collaboration: Letters or statements of support from collaborating institutions, organizations, or individuals endorsing the proposed research project. These letters demonstrate partnerships, collaborations, or commitments of resources necessary for the successful completion of the research.
6. Ethical Approval Documentation: Documentation of ethical approval or clearance obtained from institutional review boards (IRBs) or ethics committees, if applicable. Ethical approval ensures that the research project complies with ethical standards and safeguards the rights and welfare of human participants or animal subjects involved in the research.
7. Project Timeline: A timeline or Gantt chart illustrating the planned schedule of activities and milestones for the research project. The project timeline helps visualize the sequence of tasks and dependencies, facilitating project management and monitoring.
8. Archived Project Proposal: Copies or versions of the project proposal document archived in a data repository or institutional repository for future reference and transparency. Archiving the project proposal ensures that it is accessible and retrievable throughout the lifecycle of the research project.

By organizing these documents in the "plan/project_proposal" folder, researchers provide a comprehensive overview of the proposed research project, its objectives, methodology, and budget. Project proposals serve as a roadmap for conducting the research and securing funding, demonstrating the feasibility, significance, and impact of the proposed work.
