# Plan

A folder named "plan" within a deposit accompanying a research paper typically contains documents related to planning the research project. Here's what you might find in a "plan" folder:

1. Project Proposal: A document outlining the proposed research project, including its objectives, research questions, methodology, expected outcomes, timeline, and budget. While project proposals are often not published, they provide a roadmap for conducting the research and securing funding.
2. Preregistration: A preregistration document detailing the research hypotheses, study design, data collection methods, and analysis plan before conducting the research. Preregistrations help reduce bias and promote transparency by documenting the research plan in advance. Preregistrations can be published on platforms like the Open Science Framework.
3. Data Management Plan (DMP): A document outlining how data will be collected, managed, stored, shared, and preserved throughout the research project and beyond. DMPs ensure that data are handled responsibly, ethically, and in compliance with relevant regulations and policies. DMPs can be created using templates provided by DMP-tools or specific institutions like MADataPlan.
4. Software Management Plan (SMP): A document detailing how software developed or used in the research project will be managed, maintained, documented, and shared. SMPs ensure that software is sustainable, reproducible, and accessible to others. SMPs can be created using guidelines provided by sources like forschungsdaten.info or specific institutions like MADataPlan.
5. Archived Plans: Copies or versions of the project proposal, preregistration, DMP, and SMP archived in a data repository for future reference and transparency. Archiving these plans ensures that they are accessible and retrievable throughout the lifecycle of the research project.

Including a "plan" folder alongside the research paper deposit demonstrates the researchers' commitment to rigorous planning, transparency, and responsible research conduct. These planning documents provide a foundation for conducting high-quality research, promoting open science practices, and enhancing the reproducibility and integrity of the research findings.

## Project proposal

Project proposals are often not published. But they can be published in [Research Ideas and Outcomes](https://riojournal.com).

## Preregistration

You can create and publish your preregistration in [Open Science Framework](https://help.osf.io/article/158-create-a-preregistration).

## Data management plan

To create a data management plan you can use a template of a DMP-tool listed at [Awesome RDM repo](https://help.osf.io/article/158-create-a-preregistration). If you study or work at the University of Mannheim, you can use [MADataPlan](https://fdz.bib.uni-mannheim.de/madataplan). Consider to archive your DMP in a data repository.

## Software management plan

To create a software management plan you can use information provided at [forschungsdaten.info](https://forschungsdaten.info/praxis-kompakt/english-pages/software-management-plans/). If you study or work at the University of Mannheim, you can use [MADataPlan](https://fdz.bib.uni-mannheim.de/madataplan). Consider to archive your SMP in a data repository.
