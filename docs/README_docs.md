# Docs

A folder named "docs" within a deposit accompanying a research paper typically contains various types of documentation related to the research project. Based on the provided extra knowledge, here's what you might find in a "docs" folder:

* Papers:
  * Research Paper: The primary paper describing the research findings, methodology, results, and conclusions.
  * Data Paper (if applicable): A separate paper specifically focused on describing the dataset collected or created as part of the research. This paper may provide details about the dataset's structure, content, collection methods, and potential reuse.
  * Software Paper (if applicable): Another separate paper dedicated to describing any reusable software developed as part of the research project. This paper may outline the software's functionality, features, architecture, usage instructions, and potential applications.
* Talks:
  * Abstracts: Abstracts or summaries of talks or presentations given at conferences, workshops, or seminars related to the research project.
  * Presentations: Slide decks or materials used during oral presentations to convey the research findings, methodology, and results.
  * Posters: Digital or print posters used for presenting the research visually at conferences, showcasing key aspects of the project.
* Reports:
  * Any additional reports or documents providing detailed insights, analyses, or updates on the research project. These reports may cover specific aspects of the research in more depth than the main research paper.
* Blogs:
  * Blog posts or articles written by the researchers or collaborators discussing various aspects of the research project. These could include reflections on the research process, explanations of key concepts, or discussions of implications and future directions.

Overall, the "docs" folder serves as a repository for disseminating various forms of documentation associated with the research project, including formal papers, presentations, reports, and informal communication such as blogs. This collection of documentation enhances the visibility, accessibility, and impact of the research findings, making them available to a wider audience of researchers, practitioners, and stakeholders.
