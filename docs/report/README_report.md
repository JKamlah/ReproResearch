# Report

A folder named "docs/report" within a deposit accompanying a research paper typically contains documents related to a research report or project report. Here's what you might find in a "docs/report" folder:

1. Research Report Document: The primary document containing the research report or project report itself. This document provides a detailed account of the research project, including the background, objectives, methodology, findings, analysis, discussion, and conclusions.
2. Executive Summary: A summary document highlighting the key findings, insights, and conclusions of the research report. The executive summary provides a concise overview for readers who may not have time to read the full report but need to understand its main points.
3. Methodology Section: A section of the research report dedicated to describing the research methodology, including research design, data collection methods, sampling techniques, data analysis procedures, and any limitations or challenges encountered during the research process.
4. Findings and Analysis: Sections of the research report presenting the findings of the study and analyzing the data collected. This may include tables, charts, graphs, and visualizations to support the presentation of results and facilitate understanding.
5. Discussion and Interpretation: A section of the research report where the findings are interpreted and discussed in relation to the research objectives, relevant literature, theoretical frameworks, and implications for theory, practice, or policy.
6. Conclusion and Recommendations: A concluding section of the research report summarizing the main findings, drawing conclusions, and providing recommendations for future research, practice, or policy based on the study's findings.
7. References and Citations: A list of references cited in the research report, following a specific citation style (e.g., APA, MLA, Chicago). References provide credibility to the research findings and allow readers to locate and verify the sources of information cited in the report.
8. Appendices: Supplementary materials or additional information that supplements the main content of the research report. Appendices may include raw data, survey instruments, interview transcripts, detailed analyses, or other supporting documentation.

By organizing these documents in the "docs/report" folder, researchers ensure that all relevant report-related materials are easily accessible and organized. Research reports provide a comprehensive account of the research project's objectives, methods, findings, and conclusions, facilitating knowledge dissemination and sharing research findings with the academic community and other stakeholders.
