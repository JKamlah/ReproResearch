# Software paper

A folder named "docs/papers/software_paper" within a deposit accompanying a research paper typically contains a software paper. A software paper is a scholarly publication specifically focused on describing a reusable software tool or program developed as part of a research project. Here's what you might find in a "docs/papers/software_paper" folder:

1. Software Paper Document: The primary document containing the software paper itself. This paper provides detailed information about the software tool, including its purpose, functionality, features, architecture, implementation details, usage instructions, and potential applications in research or practice.
2. Documentation: Supplementary documentation files providing additional information about the software tool, such as user guides, technical manuals, installation instructions, configuration options, and troubleshooting tips. Documentation helps users understand and utilize the software effectively, facilitating its adoption and use in various contexts.
3. Source Code: If permitted, the folder might contain the source code or executable files of the software tool. Source code allows users to inspect, modify, and extend the software, fostering transparency, collaboration, and community-driven development efforts.
4. Dependencies: Information about the dependencies or requirements necessary to run the software tool, such as libraries, frameworks, runtime environments, or compatible operating systems. Clear documentation of dependencies helps users set up the software environment correctly and avoid compatibility issues.
5. License Information: Information specifying the licensing terms under which the software tool is distributed or made available to others. Licensing ensures legal compliance and clarifies the rights and obligations associated with using, modifying, sharing, or redistributing the software.
6. Citation Information: Guidance on how to cite the software paper and the software tool in scholarly publications, ensuring proper attribution to the original creators and contributors of the software.
7. Acknowledgments: Acknowledgments of individuals, institutions, or funding agencies that supported the development of the software tool. Acknowledgments recognize the contributions and support received during the research project.

Including a "docs/papers/software_paper" folder alongside the research paper deposit allows researchers to formally publish and disseminate information about the software tool, making it more visible, accessible, and reusable by other researchers in the scientific community. Software papers play a crucial role in promoting transparency, reproducibility, and software sharing practices, ultimately enhancing the integrity and impact of scientific research.
