# Data paper

A folder named "docs/papers/paper" within a deposit accompanying a research paper typically contains the main research paper itself. Here's what you might find in a "docs/papers/paper" folder:

1. Research Paper Document: The primary document containing the research paper itself. This paper presents the original research conducted by the authors, including details about the research question, methodology, experimental design, results, analysis, discussion, and conclusions.
2. Supplementary Materials: Additional materials related to the research paper, such as appendices, figures, tables, or supplementary analyses. Supplementary materials provide further insights, details, or supporting evidence that complement the main content of the research paper.
3. Metadata: Metadata files providing additional information about the research paper, such as author affiliations, keywords, abstract, publication date, and citation details. Metadata enhances the discoverability and accessibility of the research paper in academic databases and repositories.
4. License Information: Information specifying the licensing terms under which the research paper is distributed or made available to others. Licensing ensures legal compliance and clarifies the rights and obligations associated with accessing, using, or distributing the research paper.
5. Citation Information: Guidance on how to cite the research paper in scholarly publications, ensuring proper attribution to the original authors and contributors of the research.
6. Acknowledgments: Acknowledgments of individuals, institutions, or funding agencies that supported the research project. Acknowledgments recognize the contributions and support received during the research process.

Including a "docs/papers/paper" folder alongside the research paper deposit allows researchers to provide access to the full text of the research paper, along with relevant supplementary materials and metadata. This facilitates the dissemination, visibility, and impact of the research findings within the academic community and beyond.
