# Papers

A folder named "docs/papers" within a deposit accompanying a research paper typically contains various types of academic papers related to the research project. Here's what you might find in a "docs/papers" folder:

1. Research Paper: The primary research paper describing the research findings, methodology, results, and conclusions. This is the main document that presents the original research conducted by the authors.
2. Data Paper (if applicable): A separate paper specifically focused on describing the dataset collected or created as part of the research. This paper may provide details about the dataset's structure, content, collection methods, and potential reuse. Data papers are common in fields where datasets are significant contributions to research.
3. Software Paper (if applicable): Another separate paper dedicated to describing any reusable software developed as part of the research project. This paper may outline the software's functionality, features, architecture, usage instructions, and potential applications. Software papers help disseminate information about the software tool to the academic community. 
4. Literature Review Papers: Papers that provide comprehensive reviews and summaries of existing literature relevant to the research topic. These papers help situate the current research within the broader context of existing knowledge and highlight gaps or areas for further investigation.
5. Methodological Papers: Papers that discuss the methodologies, techniques, or experimental protocols used in the research project. These papers may provide detailed explanations of specific research methods, their rationale, implementation details, and validation procedures.
6. Review Papers: Comprehensive review articles that synthesize and analyze existing research findings on a particular topic. Review papers typically provide insights, critiques, and future directions for research in the field.
7. Supplementary Papers: Additional papers related to the research project, such as conference proceedings, workshop papers, or supplementary materials accompanying the main research paper.

By organizing academic papers in the "docs/papers" folder, researchers make relevant literature and documentation easily accessible to readers interested in exploring the research topic further. This collection of papers provides context, background information, and additional insights that complement the main research paper, enhancing the understanding and impact of the research findings within the academic community.
