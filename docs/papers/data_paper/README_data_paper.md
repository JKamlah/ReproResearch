# Data paper

A folder named "docs/papers/data_paper" within a deposit accompanying a research paper typically contains a data paper. A data paper is a scholarly publication specifically focused on describing a dataset collected or created as part of a research project. Here's what you might find in a "docs/papers/data_paper" folder:

1. Data Paper Document: The primary document containing the data paper itself. This paper provides detailed information about the dataset, including its purpose, collection methods, structure, content, quality assessment, potential applications, and implications for research and practice.
2. Metadata: Metadata files providing additional information about the dataset, such as variable descriptions, units of measurement, data formats, and any relevant contextual information. Metadata enhances the understanding and usability of the dataset for other researchers.
3. Data Documentation: Supplementary documentation files or data dictionaries explaining the structure, contents, and usage of the dataset. Data documentation helps users navigate and interpret the dataset effectively, facilitating its reuse and reproducibility in future research.
4. License Information: Information specifying the terms under which the dataset is licensed or made available to others. Clear licensing ensures legal compliance and clarifies the rights and obligations associated with accessing, using, or distributing the dataset.
5. Citation Information: Guidance on how to cite the data paper and the dataset in scholarly publications, ensuring proper attribution to the original creators and contributors of the dataset.
6. Acknowledgments: Acknowledgments of individuals, institutions, or funding agencies that supported the collection or creation of the dataset. Acknowledgments recognize the contributions and support received during the research project.
7. Supplementary Materials: Additional materials, such as appendices, figures, tables, or supplementary analyses, that provide further insights into the dataset or its collection process.

Including a "docs/papers/data_paper" folder alongside the research paper deposit allows researchers to formally publish and disseminate information about the dataset, making it more visible, accessible, and reusable by other researchers in the scientific community. Data papers play a crucial role in promoting transparency, reproducibility, and data sharing practices, ultimately enhancing the integrity and impact of scientific research.
