# Processed data

In a research paper, especially within fields that involve extensive data analysis (like computational sciences, social sciences, health sciences, and many others), the "processed data" folder is a crucial component of the research deposit. This folder typically contains datasets that have undergone preprocessing steps to make them suitable for analysis or modeling. The preprocessing steps are meant to clean and transform raw data into a format that is more directly applicable to the research questions being addressed. The contents of a "processed data" folder might include:

1. Cleaned Data: Datasets where issues such as missing values, duplicates, or irrelevant entries have been resolved. Cleaning ensures the data is accurate and suitable for analysis.
2. Normalized or Standardized Data: Data that have been scaled or transformed to ensure that different variables or features have comparable ranges or distributions. This is especially important in machine learning models to prevent features with larger scales from dominating those with smaller scales.
3. Categorized or Encoded Data: For datasets with categorical variables, this includes versions of the data where categories have been encoded as numbers or binary variables (one-hot encoding), making them suitable for computational analysis.
4. Transformed Data: Datasets that have undergone transformations, such as logarithmic or polynomial transformations, to address non-linearity or other statistical properties that could affect analysis.
5. Feature-engineered Data: Data where new variables (features) have been created or selected from the raw data, based on domain knowledge or exploratory analysis, to improve the performance of statistical or machine learning models.
6. Aggregated Data: For research involving time series or grouped data, this might include datasets where original observations have been aggregated (e.g., summed, averaged) over time periods or groups.
7. Subsetted Data: Versions of the dataset that have been reduced or subsetted based on certain criteria, such as time frames, geographic locations, or specific populations, to focus the analysis on relevant parts of the data.
8. Documentation and Metadata: Accompanying documents that describe the preprocessing steps taken, the rationale behind them, and any important characteristics of the processed data. Metadata might include information on the structure of the data files, variable definitions, and units of measurement.
9. Scripts or Code for Preprocessing: Often, the folder will also include scripts or code that were used to preprocess the raw data. These scripts provide transparency into how the processed data were derived and allow others to replicate or build upon the research.

Including a "processed data" folder in a research deposit serves multiple purposes. It ensures transparency about how the data was prepared for analysis, facilitates reproducibility of the research findings by others, and often fulfills requirements of academic journals or funding agencies for open data. The exact contents and structure of this folder can vary depending on the specific research project, the type of data, and the analytical methods used.
