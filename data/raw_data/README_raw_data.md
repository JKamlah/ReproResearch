# Raw data

A "raw data" folder in a research paper deposit is fundamental for ensuring the transparency, reproducibility, and integrity of the research process. This folder contains the initial data collected or used by researchers before any processing, cleaning, or analysis has been performed. The specific contents can vary significantly depending on the discipline, the nature of the research, and the methods used for data collection. Generally, the "raw data" folder may include:

1. Data Files: The core of the folder, these files hold the unprocessed data exactly as it was collected or received. Formats can vary widely, from text files (CSV, JSON, XML) and spreadsheets (Excel) to more specialized formats used in specific fields (e.g., FASTA files in genomics, DICOM files in medical imaging).
2. Survey Responses: For studies based on surveys or questionnaires, this includes the original responses from participants, including all answers as they were provided, without any modifications, filtering, or coding.
3. Experimental Results: In experimental research, this could comprise the initial measurements, observations, or outputs from experiments or laboratory tests.
4. Audio and Video Recordings: For research involving interviews, observations, or experiments that are recorded, the raw audio and video files are included.
5. Images: Original images used or collected during the study, such as photographs from field research, microscopy images in biological studies, or satellite images in environmental research.
6. Database Exports: For research that utilizes existing databases, this might include export files representing the data as it was extracted from the database before any processing.
7. Instrument and Sensor Outputs: Raw output files from instruments, sensors, or other devices used to collect data. This can include log files, readouts, or any digital representation of the measurements taken.
8. Codebooks and Questionnaires: While not data in the strictest sense, including the instruments used to collect the data (e.g., the questionnaire itself, coding schemas, or the layout of data collection instruments) is crucial for understanding the structure and meaning of the raw data.
9. Metadata and Documentation: Accompanying documentation that describes the context, collection methods, and structure of the raw data. Metadata might detail the time and location of data collection, the parameters or settings of instruments used, and any relevant conditions or events during collection.
10. Ethical Approvals and Consent Forms: Copies of ethical approval documents and anonymized consent forms (where applicable), ensuring that the study was conducted in accordance with ethical standards and that participants were informed about the research purposes and their rights.

The inclusion of a comprehensive "raw data" folder is a best practice in research, promoting integrity and allowing other researchers to validate findings, conduct further analysis, or apply the data to new questions. However, researchers must ensure that any sensitive information is appropriately anonymized or protected to respect privacy and confidentiality agreements.
