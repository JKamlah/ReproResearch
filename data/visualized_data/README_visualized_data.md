# Visualized data

A "visualized data" folder in a deposit to a research paper is specifically dedicated to housing visual representations of the research data, analyses, and results. This visual content plays a crucial role in communicating complex information in an accessible and interpretable manner, allowing both experts and non-experts to grasp the findings more intuitively. The folder can contain a wide array of visual materials, including but not limited to:

1. Figures: High-resolution images of all the figures presented in the paper, which might include photographs, diagrams, flowcharts, or graphical abstracts that summarize the main findings.
2. Charts: Graphical representations of data, such as bar charts, line graphs, pie charts, scatter plots, and histograms, which illustrate trends, distributions, comparisons, and relationships among variables.
3. Graphs: More complex graphical representations, such as network graphs, tree diagrams, or heatmaps, which are often used in specialized fields to illustrate relationships or patterns within the data.
4. Maps: Geographic maps that display spatial data, trends, or patterns relevant to the study, often used in environmental studies, epidemiology, and social sciences.
5. Schematic Diagrams: Detailed schematics that explain mechanisms, processes, or models proposed in the research, useful in fields like engineering, physics, and biology.
6. Supplementary Visualizations: Additional visual content that supports but was not included in the main text due to space constraints or to maintain narrative flow. These can further elucidate study results, methodologies, or theoretical concepts.
7. Animated Figures or Interactive Visualizations: If applicable, the folder might include or link to animated versions of static figures or interactive visualizations that allow for a more dynamic exploration of the data.
8. Data Visualization Code: For transparency and reproducibility, this folder can also contain the code or scripts used to generate the figures and charts, including any specific software or tools used in the visualization process.
9. High-Quality or Print-Ready Versions: For publications that require or allow for the submission of print-quality graphics, this folder may include versions of the figures and charts suitable for high-resolution printing, often in vector formats.
10. Legend and Annotation Files: Separate files detailing the legends, annotations, or any supplementary explanations for the figures and charts, especially if these elements were too detailed to be included within the visualizations themselves.
11. Ethical and Permission Documents: If the visualized data includes photographs of subjects or copyrighted materials, this folder may also contain permissions, releases, or ethical approval documents related to their use.

Including a comprehensive "visualized data" folder ensures that all visual materials related to the paper are organized, accessible, and presented in the highest possible quality. This facilitates a better understanding of the research findings, aids in the paper's review process, and enhances the overall impact of the published work.
