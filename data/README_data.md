# Data

A folder named "data" within a deposit accompanying a research paper typically contains the datasets or raw data used in the research project. Here's what you might find in a "data" folder:
* raw data
* processed data
* visualized data (e.g., figures for papers)
* supplemented materials (from papers)
* appendix (from papers)
* models (e.g., models for machine and deep learning)

Including a "data" folder alongside the research paper deposit promotes transparency, reproducibility, and reusability of research findings. Other researchers can access the datasets used in the study, replicate the analysis, verify the results, or build upon the work for further research. This facilitates collaboration, enhances scientific progress, and ensures the integrity of research outcomes.

## Data availability statement

Include data availability statement at the end of your paper. For example, "All data used in this research are freely available at URL under the CC BY license."

## Models

The models can be additionally uploaded to [Hugging Face Models](https://huggingface.co/models) and you can [generate a DOI](https://huggingface.co/docs/hub/doi) for them.
