# Supplemented materials

Supplementary materials to a research paper are additional files or resources that support the content of the paper but are not included in the main body of the text. These materials provide further depth and evidence to the research findings, allowing authors to include detailed information without disrupting the flow or exceeding the page limits of the main manuscript. Supplementary materials can be diverse, reflecting the varied nature of research across disciplines. Common types of supplemented materials include:

1. Detailed Methodological Information: Extended descriptions of the methods used in the study that are too lengthy for the main text, including experimental procedures, detailed descriptions of study design, and protocols.
2. Additional Data Tables and Figures: Data that support the paper's findings but are too voluminous for the main text. This can include extended data tables, additional graphs or charts, and detailed statistical analyses.
3. Raw and Processed Data Files: Datasets that the research is based on, often divided into raw data (as collected) and processed data (after any cleaning or manipulation), enabling other researchers to replicate the study or conduct further analyses.
4. Software and Code: Source code for custom software, scripts for data analysis, or models developed as part of the research, along with documentation on how to use them. This supports reproducibility and allows others to build upon the work.
5. Supplementary Visual Materials: Additional visual content such as images, videos, or animations that provide further insights into the research findings, experimental setups, or illustrate complex processes.
6. Questionnaires and Survey Instruments: Copies of survey instruments, questionnaires, and other tools used to collect data, along with scoring keys if applicable.
7. Extended Literature Reviews: Supplementary background information or a more extensive review of the literature than what is presented in the main paper.
8. Proofs and Calculations: Detailed mathematical derivations, proofs, and calculations that are essential for substantiating the research findings but are too detailed for the main text.
9. Case Studies: Extended descriptions of case studies, including background information, detailed analyses, and interpretations.
10. Audio or Transcript Files: For studies involving interviews or qualitative research, transcripts of interviews or focus groups, and possibly the audio files themselves, provided that they adhere to ethical standards for privacy and consent.
11. Ethical Approval Documents and Consent Forms: Documentation of ethical approval for the study and anonymized copies of consent forms, ensuring the research adheres to ethical guidelines.
12. Glossary: Definitions of specialized terms, acronyms, and jargon used in the paper, helpful for readers unfamiliar with the topic.

Including supplementary materials with a research paper enhances the transparency of the research process, supports the reproducibility of the results, and provides a richer context for understanding the research findings. Publishers often host these materials on their websites, linked directly from the research paper, ensuring they are accessible to readers.
