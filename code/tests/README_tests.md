# Tests

A folder named "code/tests" within a research paper deposit typically contains test scripts or unit tests designed to verify the correctness and functionality of the code accompanying the research paper. These tests are crucial for ensuring the reliability and robustness of the software used in the research project.

Here's what you might find in a "code/tests" folder:

1. Unit tests: These are small, focused tests that validate individual units or components of the code in isolation. Unit tests check specific functions, methods, or classes to ensure they produce the expected output for a given input.
2. Integration tests: These tests verify that different components of the code work together correctly when integrated. Integration tests examine the interactions between various modules, libraries, or services to confirm that they cooperate as intended.
3. Regression tests: These tests detect unintended changes or regressions in the codebase. Regression tests ensure that modifications or updates to the code do not introduce new bugs or break existing functionality.
4. Functional tests: These tests assess the overall behavior and functionality of the software from an end-user perspective. Functional tests simulate user interactions or system operations to validate that the software performs its intended tasks correctly.
5. Test fixtures and data: The "code/tests" folder might also include fixtures, sample data, or mock objects used for testing purposes. These resources help set up the testing environment and provide consistent input for the tests.
6. Test runners and frameworks: If applicable, the folder might contain configuration files or scripts for running the tests using testing frameworks such as pytest, unittest, or JUnit.

Including a "code/tests" folder alongside the research paper deposit demonstrates a commitment to software quality assurance and facilitates the reproducibility of research results. Other researchers can run these tests to verify the correctness of the code, ensuring that the findings reported in the paper are reliable and trustworthy. Additionally, test-driven development practices encourage better code design, documentation, and maintainability throughout the research project.
