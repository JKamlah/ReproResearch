# Notebooks

A folder named "code/notebooks" within a research paper deposit typically contains Jupyter notebooks or other interactive computational documents that accompany the research paper. Jupyter notebooks are popular in scientific computing and data analysis because they allow researchers to combine code, text, visualizations, and other multimedia elements in a single document.

In the context of a research paper, the "code/notebooks" folder might contain:

1. Jupyter notebooks: These notebooks often contain executable code cells interspersed with markdown cells explaining the analysis, methodology, and results. They provide a comprehensive and interactive way to present and reproduce computational experiments conducted as part of the research.
2. Data preprocessing scripts: Notebooks within this folder might include scripts for data preprocessing, cleaning, and transformation. These scripts help ensure transparency and reproducibility by documenting the steps taken to prepare the data for analysis.
3. Data visualization notebooks: Some notebooks might focus on data visualization, showcasing various plots, charts, and graphs generated during the analysis. These notebooks help convey the results of the research in a visually appealing and informative manner.
4. Model training and evaluation notebooks: If the research involves machine learning or statistical modeling, the notebooks might include code for training models, hyperparameter tuning, cross-validation, and evaluating model performance.
5. Supplementary analysis notebooks: Researchers might include additional notebooks for exploratory data analysis, sensitivity analysis, or robustness checks that complement the main analysis presented in the paper.

By including the "code/notebooks" folder alongside the research paper deposit, authors provide readers with an opportunity to interactively explore and reproduce the computational aspects of the research. This promotes transparency, enhances reproducibility, and facilitates further experimentation and extension of the work by other researchers.
