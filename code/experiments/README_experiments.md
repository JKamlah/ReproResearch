# Experiments

A folder named "code/experiments" within a research paper deposit typically contains the source code or scripts used to conduct experiments described in the research paper. This folder might include programming code written in various languages (such as Python, R, MATLAB, etc.) that implement algorithms, simulations, data analysis, or other computational procedures mentioned in the paper.

Researchers often include this folder to provide transparency and reproducibility of their results. By sharing the code used in experiments, other researchers can verify the findings, replicate the experiments, or build upon the work for further research.

In addition to code files, this folder might also contain documentation, README files, or instructions to help other researchers understand how to use the code and replicate the experiments successfully. This helps ensure that the research findings are not only credible but also accessible and usable by the broader scientific community.
