# Code

A folder named "code" within a deposit accompanying a research paper typically contains the software artifacts related to the research. This folder often includes the source code, scripts, and other programming-related materials utilized in the research project. Here's what you might find in a "code" folder:

1. Source code: This is the primary component of the "code" folder. It contains the actual programming code written by the researchers to implement algorithms, conduct simulations, perform data analysis, or build computational models described in the research paper. The source code may be written in various programming languages such as Python, R, MATLAB, Java, C++, etc., depending on the nature of the research.
2. Scripts: Alongside source code files, there may be scripts or executable files that automate certain tasks, perform data preprocessing, generate plots or visualizations, or run experiments described in the paper.
3. Configuration files: These files specify settings, parameters, or options required to run the code or experiments correctly. Configuration files help ensure consistency and reproducibility across different environments.
4. Documentation: The "code" folder might contain documentation files such as README files, user guides, or technical notes explaining how to use the code, reproduce the experiments, or set up the development environment. Documentation is crucial for other researchers to understand and utilize the software effectively.
5. Dependencies: If the code relies on external libraries, packages, or modules, there might be files specifying the dependencies required to run the code. This could include configuration files like requirements.txt (for Python projects using pip) or environment.yml (for projects using conda).
6. License information: Researchers often include licensing information in the "code" folder to specify the terms under which others can use, modify, or distribute the software. This ensures legal compliance and clarifies the rights and obligations associated with the code.

Overall, the "code" folder serves as a repository for the computational aspects of the research project. It enables transparency, reproducibility, and collaboration by providing access to the software artifacts used to generate the results presented in the research paper. Other researchers can examine the code, replicate the experiments, build upon the work, or verify the findings, thereby advancing scientific progress.

## Code availability statement

Include "Code availability statement" at the end of your paper. For example, "All codes used in this research are openly available at URL under MIT license."
